# WhatTheDuck README

**WhatTheDuck** is an AI-powered assistant designed to boost your refactoring experience in VSCode. Not only is it a powerful tool, but it also takes the form of a Rubber Duck: the iconic problem-solving companion every developer needs.

## Features

 - Rename Variables
 - [Inline Temporary Variables](https://refactoring.guru/inline-temp)
 - [Extract Variables](https://refactoring.guru/extract-variable)
 - [Extract Methods](https://refactoring.guru/extract-method)
 - [Rename Methods](https://refactoring.guru/rename-method)
 - [Inline Methods](https://refactoring.guru/inline-method)
 - [Replace Temp with Query](https://refactoring.guru/replace-temp-with-query)
 - [Remove Assignments to Parameters](https://refactoring.guru/remove-assignments-to-parameters)
 - [Remove Parameter](https://refactoring.guru/remove-parameter)
 - [Replace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant](https://refactoring.guru/replace-magic-number-with-symbolic-constant)
 - [Consolidate Duplicate Conditionals](https://refactoring.guru/consolidate-duplicate-conditional-fragments)
 - [Remove Nested Conditionals](https://refactoring.guru/replace-nested-conditional-with-guard-clauses)

Moreover, it is possible to preview **WhatTheDuck**'s changes before applying them to your code! You can then accept or reject those changes. Below, we present a preview of **WhatTheDuck**'s capabilities so far:
