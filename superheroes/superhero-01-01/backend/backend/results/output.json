            "description": "Several sections of the code (especially within the `run` method's main loop) are prone to unhandled exceptions which may lead to data corruption or loss. These sections should be wrapped in `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle potential errors.",

The function uses different error messages for different scenarios (e.g., 'List action must have a valid url', 'No workers available', 'Worker not available'). Standardizing the error format would improve consistency and debugging.",

    "feedback": "The code demonstrates a functional implementation of a hash ring-based message broker. However, it suffers from significant robustness issues due to inadequate error handling and potential for unhandled exceptions. Addressing these issues is crucial for reliable operation.  Minor improvements in configuration and logging would also enhance maintainability.",
