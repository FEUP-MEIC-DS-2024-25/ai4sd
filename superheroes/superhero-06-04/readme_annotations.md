# Dev informations

EVERY STRING SHOULD NOT BE SPECIFIED IN THE CODE.
ALL STRINGS SHOULD BE EXTERNALIZED INTO FILES.
YOU CAN CREATE A FOLDER NAMED "strings" OR SIMILAR.
THERE SHOULD BE A FILE READER INITIALIZED BEFORE ALL ELSE IN THE APP.
EACH DIFFERENT FILE WILL NEED TO HAVE A FILE READER (or file reader config) ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

ALL CURRENT STRINGS IN THE CODE SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH THE INFORMATION FROM THE FILE READER.
