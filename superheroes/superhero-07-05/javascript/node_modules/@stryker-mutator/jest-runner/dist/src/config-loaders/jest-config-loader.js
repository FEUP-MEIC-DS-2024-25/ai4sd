/**
 * The ConfigLoader interface is used to load different kinds of configurations for Jest.
 * Custom ConfigLoaders should implement this interface, the OptionsEditor will then be able to use it to load a Jest configuration.
 *
 * ConfigLoaders are typically used for projects that do not provide their configuration via the package.json file (e.g. React).
 * The loaderConfig method will return a usable config for Jest to use.
