There are only two code snippets provided, and neither is a test.  They are both implementations of a `sum` function, but neither is accompanied by any test cases.  To select tests bigger than 5, I need test cases to evaluate.  Provide test cases (e.g., using a testing framework like Jest, Mocha, etc.) and I can then select the ones that meet your criteria.
