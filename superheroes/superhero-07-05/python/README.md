# Install mutmut
We used *mutmut* to generate mutation tests, so it needs to be installed.
```bash
pip install mutmut
mutmut run
```

# Generate mutation tests
1. Insert your code into the *my_code.py* file and the test code into the *test_my_code.py* file.
2. After that, you only need to run the *script.sh*. It will give you the *mutation_report_filtered.txt* file where you will have all the mutation tests generated.
