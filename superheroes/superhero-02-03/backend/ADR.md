# Architectural Decision Record: Microservices, Event-Driven, Serverless, and DDD for CleanArch

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project aims to develop a Clean Architecture-based application for managing games and platforms.  Scalability, maintainability, and testability are key priorities. The chosen architectural patterns address these concerns:

* **Microservices Architecture:** Decomposing the application into independent services (e.g., Game Service, Platform Service) enhances modularity, allows independent deployment and scaling, and improves fault isolation.
* **Event-Driven Architecture:**  Facilitates asynchronous communication between services, promoting loose coupling and responsiveness. This is crucial for handling events like adding a new game or updating platform information.
* **Serverless Architecture:** Leveraging serverless functions reduces operational overhead and allows automatic scaling based on demand, optimizing resource utilization and cost-effectiveness.
* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):**  Focusing on the core domain (games and platforms) and using a ubiquitous language improves communication between developers and domain experts, leading to a more accurate and maintainable model.

## Decision

The application will be structured as a set of microservices, each responsible for a specific domain aspect (e.g., Game Management, Platform Management, User Authentication). These services will communicate asynchronously via an event bus, using a publish-subscribe pattern.  Serverless functions will be employed to implement the core logic of each microservice.  DDD principles will be applied throughout the development process, including the use of entities, value objects, aggregates, and repositories. The project structure reflects these patterns by organizing code into distinct modules aligned with domain concepts.

## Consequences

**Positive Consequences:**

* **Improved Scalability:** Individual services can be scaled independently based on their specific needs.
* **Enhanced Maintainability:**  Changes within one service are less likely to impact others.
* **Increased Testability:**  Smaller, independent units of code are easier to test thoroughly.
* **Faster Development Cycles:**  Independent teams can work on different services concurrently.
* **Reduced Operational Costs:** Serverless architecture optimizes resource utilization.
* **Better Domain Alignment:** DDD ensures the software model accurately reflects the business domain.

**Negative Consequences:**

* **Increased Complexity:**  Managing multiple services and their interactions can be more complex than a monolithic application.
* **Distributed Debugging:** Tracing issues across multiple services can be challenging.
* **Eventual Consistency:** Asynchronous communication introduces the possibility of eventual consistency, which needs to be carefully managed.
* **Initial Setup Overhead:** Setting up the infrastructure for microservices and serverless functions can require more initial effort.
