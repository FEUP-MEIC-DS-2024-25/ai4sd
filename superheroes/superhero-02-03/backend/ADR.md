# Adoption of Microservices and Event-Driven Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This project aims to develop a robust and scalable system for managing and analyzing data related to traffic accidents.  The initial monolithic architecture presented limitations in terms of scalability, maintainability, and independent evolution of different functionalities. We faced challenges with:

* **Tight Coupling:**  Changes in one part of the system often required modifications in other parts, increasing development time and the risk of introducing bugs.
* **Limited Scalability:** Scaling the entire application for specific functionalities (e.g., real-time accident reporting) proved inefficient.
* **Technology Lock-in:** The monolithic architecture made it difficult to adopt new technologies without impacting the entire system.

To address these concerns, we decided to adopt a **Microservices architecture** combined with an **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**. Microservices allow us to decompose the system into smaller, independent services, each focusing on a specific business capability. This enhances modularity, independent deployability, and technology diversity.  EDA facilitates asynchronous communication between services, promoting loose coupling and improved responsiveness.  These patterns were chosen specifically to:

* **Improve Scalability:** Individual microservices can be scaled independently based on their specific needs.
* **Enhance Maintainability:** Smaller, focused services are easier to understand, modify, and test.
* **Increase Development Velocity:** Independent teams can work on different services concurrently, accelerating development.
* **Enable Technology Diversity:**  Each microservice can be built with the most appropriate technology stack.
* **Improve Fault Tolerance:** The failure of one microservice does not necessarily impact the entire system.


## Decision

We will decompose the system into the following core microservices:

* **Accident Reporting Service:**  Handles the ingestion and validation of accident reports.
* **Data Processing Service:** Processes and analyzes accident data, potentially using machine learning algorithms.
* **Visualization Service:** Provides a user interface for visualizing accident data and insights.
* **Notification Service:**  Sends notifications to relevant parties (e.g., emergency services) based on accident reports.
* **User Management Service:**  Manages user authentication and authorization.

These services will communicate asynchronously using an event bus (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).  Key events will include:

* `AccidentReported`: Triggered when a new accident report is submitted.
* `AccidentDataProcessed`: Triggered when the Data Processing Service completes the analysis of an accident.
* `NotificationSent`: Triggered when a notification is successfully sent.


## Consequences

**Benefits:**

* **Improved Scalability and Performance:** Individual services can be scaled independently.
* **Enhanced Maintainability and Testability:** Smaller codebases are easier to manage and test.
* **Increased Development Velocity:** Parallel development of independent services.
* **Technology Diversity:** Flexibility to choose the best technology for each service.
* **Improved Fault Tolerance:** Isolation of failures within individual services.

**Drawbacks:**

* **Increased Complexity:** Managing distributed systems introduces new challenges related to inter-service communication, data consistency, and monitoring.
* **Operational Overhead:** Deploying and managing multiple services requires more sophisticated infrastructure and tooling.
* **Data Consistency Challenges:** Ensuring data consistency across multiple services requires careful design and implementation of data synchronization mechanisms.
* **Debugging and Monitoring Complexity:** Tracing issues across multiple services can be more challenging.

Despite the increased complexity, the long-term benefits of improved scalability, maintainability, and development velocity outweigh the drawbacks. We will mitigate the challenges by adopting best practices for microservice development, implementing robust monitoring and logging, and using appropriate tools for managing distributed systems.  We will also prioritize thorough testing and documentation to ensure the successful implementation of this architecture.
