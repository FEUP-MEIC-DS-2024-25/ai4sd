# Adoption of Microservices and CQRS Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This ADR documents the decision to adopt a microservices architecture with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for the development of the Smart Greenhouse system (project-l11gr02). The current monolithic architecture presents several challenges as the system grows in complexity and features. These challenges include:

* **Scalability:**  Scaling the entire application becomes increasingly difficult and inefficient as specific functionalities might require more resources than others.
* **Maintainability:**  Modifications and bug fixes in a large, interconnected codebase become complex, time-consuming, and risky.
* **Technology Diversity:**  Integrating new technologies or updating existing ones becomes challenging within a monolithic structure.
* **Team Collaboration:**  Parallel development and independent deployments become harder to manage with a large, shared codebase.

The **microservices architecture** addresses these challenges by decomposing the system into smaller, independent services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This promotes flexibility, maintainability, and independent team ownership.

Furthermore, **CQRS** enhances the microservices architecture by separating read and write operations. This separation allows for optimized data models and access patterns for each operation type, leading to improved performance and scalability, especially for read-heavy workloads typical of monitoring and reporting functionalities within a smart greenhouse system.

These architectural patterns were chosen to:

* **Improve scalability and performance:** Independent scaling of services and optimized read/write operations.
* **Enhance maintainability and flexibility:** Smaller, independent codebases allow for easier modifications and technology updates.
* **Promote team autonomy and parallel development:** Separate teams can work on different services concurrently.
* **Support future growth and feature expansion:** Easier integration of new functionalities and services.


## Decision

The Smart Greenhouse system will be restructured into a microservices architecture.  Key functionalities, such as sensor data acquisition, actuator control, user authentication, reporting, and alert management, will be implemented as independent services.  These services will communicate with each other using lightweight protocols such as REST APIs or message queues.

CQRS will be implemented within relevant services, particularly those dealing with reporting and data visualization, where read operations are significantly more frequent than write operations. Separate data models and access patterns will be used for read and write operations.  This might involve using separate databases or different schemas within the same database.

An API gateway will be used to manage access to the microservices and provide a unified interface for clients.  Service discovery and orchestration tools will be considered to manage the communication and deployment of the microservices.

## Consequences

**Benefits:**

* **Improved Scalability and Performance:** Individual services can be scaled independently based on their specific needs. CQRS further optimizes performance for read-heavy workloads.
* **Enhanced Maintainability and Flexibility:** Smaller codebases are easier to understand, modify, and test.  Technology choices can be made on a per-service basis.
* **Increased Development Velocity:**  Independent teams can work on different services concurrently, leading to faster development cycles.
* **Improved Fault Isolation:**  A failure in one service is less likely to impact other services.
* **Better Technology Diversity:**  Different services can be implemented using different technologies as needed.

**Challenges:**

* **Increased Complexity:** Managing a distributed system introduces new challenges related to inter-service communication, data consistency, and deployment.
* **Operational Overhead:** Monitoring and managing multiple services requires more sophisticated tooling and processes.
* **Data Consistency:** Ensuring data consistency across multiple services requires careful design and implementation of data synchronization mechanisms.
* **Initial Development Effort:**  Refactoring the existing monolithic application into microservices requires significant upfront investment.
* **Testing Complexity:** Testing interactions between services requires more sophisticated testing strategies.


Despite the challenges, the long-term benefits of adopting microservices and CQRS outweigh the initial investment and operational overhead. This architecture will enable the Smart Greenhouse system to scale effectively, adapt to changing requirements, and support future growth.
